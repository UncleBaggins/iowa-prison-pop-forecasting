- Data is updated on a monthly basis and stored within the "data" folder of this project.

### Execution:  
- In order to run a demo of our dashboard, the existing code is published to shinyapps.io [here](https://iowa-prison-forecast.shinyapps.io/iowa-prison-pop-forecasting/)
- Alternatively, if a user wishes to run the dashboard locally from RStudio, users simply need to open the index.Rmd file and "Run Document" to render the dashboard.
